🎯 HOW TO TEST DASHBOARD IMAGE UPLOAD
=====================================

✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:

1. Dashboard page opens (http://localhost:8000/dashboard.php)
2. You see "Upload Floor Plan" section
3. Drag & drop or click to upload an image
4. Click "Analyze My Floor Plan" button
5. **RESULTS APPEAR ON THE SAME PAGE** (no redirect!)

📊 EXPECTED RESULTS (On Same Page):

The upload section will HIDE and you'll see:

✅ Large Vastu Score (e.g., 75.5%)
✅ ML Score and Rule Score
✅ 5 Elements with icons:
   - 🔥 Fire
   - 💧 Water
   - 🌍 Earth
   - 💨 Air
   - 🌌 Space
✅ 2D Visualization Chart (bar + radar)
✅ Recommendations
✅ Two buttons:
   - "Manage Space Details"
   - "Analyze Another"

🔧 IF NOT WORKING:

1. Check Image Analysis Server Status:
   - Look at terminal running "python analyze_image.py"
   - Should show: "✅ Ready to analyze images!"
   - If not running, start it: python analyze_image.py

2. Check Browser Console (Press F12):
   - Look for red errors
   - Should see: "📷 Sending image to ML backend..."
   - Then: "✅ Analysis complete!"

3. Test with Simple Page:
   - Open: http://localhost:8000/TEST_IMAGE_UPLOAD.html
   - This is simpler and shows errors clearly

🎬 STEP-BY-STEP TEST:

1. Make sure image server is running:
   Terminal shows: "📷 VASTU VISION - IMAGE ANALYSIS SERVER"

2. Open dashboard.php (already open)

3. Upload any image (JPG/PNG)

4. Click "Analyze My Floor Plan"

5. Wait 2-3 seconds

6. Results appear ON THE SAME PAGE!

📝 WHAT THE CODE DOES:

When you click "Analyze":
1. Reads the image file
2. Converts to base64
3. Sends to: http://localhost:5001/analyze_image
4. ML backend processes it
5. Returns: Vastu score, elements, visualization
6. JavaScript function "displayAnalysisResults()" shows it
7. Upload section HIDES
8. Results section SHOWS
9. Smooth scroll to results

✅ NO REDIRECT - EVERYTHING ON SAME PAGE!

🐛 COMMON ISSUES:

Issue: "Nothing happens after clicking Analyze"
Fix: Check if image server is running (port 5001)

Issue: "Shows same page, no results"
Fix: Open browser console (F12), check for errors

Issue: "Server offline"
Fix: Run: python analyze_image.py

🎯 CURRENT STATUS:

Looking at terminal logs, the image analysis server IS working!
Lines 32-50 show successful image analysis with:
- Vastu Score: 75.5%
- Elements calculated
- Visualization generated

So the backend is working! If frontend not showing results,
it's likely a JavaScript issue. Check browser console!
