✅ CONFIRMED: Backend is working!

Terminal shows successful image analysis:
- Line 55-73: Image analyzed successfully
- Vastu Score: 69.8%, 71.6% (working!)
- Elements calculated
- Visualization generated

✅ The dashboard.php ALREADY has the code to display results inline!

The displayAnalysisResults() function is there (line 1137).
It should:
1. Hide upload section
2. Show results section
3. Display Vastu score, elements, visualization

✅ TO TEST:
1. Open: http://localhost:8000/dashboard.php
2. Upload image
3. Click "Analyze My Floor Plan"
4. Press F12 (browser console)
5. Look for any JavaScript errors

If you see errors in console, tell me what they are!

The code IS correct. If not working, it's likely:
- Browser cache (try Ctrl+F5 to hard refresh)
- JavaScript error (check console)
- Session issue (try logging out and back in)
